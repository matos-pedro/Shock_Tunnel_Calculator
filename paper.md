# Summary

The Proteomics Identification Database (PRIDE) is the world's largest repository for proteomics data and a founding member of ProteomeXchange. Here, we introduce [`pridepy`](https://github.com/PRIDE-Archive/pridepy), a Python client designed to access PRIDE Archive data, including project metadata and file downloads. pride offers a flexible programmatic interface for searching, retrieving, and downloading data via the PRIDE REST API. This tool simplifies the integration of PRIDE datasets into bioinformatics pipelines, making it easier for researchers to handle large datasets programmatically.
